# CHROME EXTENSION using vanilla html, css and javascript

Hi,

This is a chrome extension that is made using vanilla html, css and javascript.
This is extension can be used for saving bullet point while you are working on chrome, saving links and also you can save the link of the current tab of the current window.

This extension is not publicly available since this was just a practice project. If you have a better way to present it, go ahead, I am all ears to suggestions for improvement.

Have Fun!!
